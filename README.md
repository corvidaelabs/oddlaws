# oddlaws

This repository serves as a sandbox for experimenting with oddlaws data applications

## Ideas

> A way to easily see who was involved for each RP event we do.
> The ability to see every event in chronological order and tunnel in to see more info about each event
> A search function to easily find people by name or RP character name
> A way to easily see the cast who made the event possible
> Every person has a profile where you can easily see their socials and any screenshots they submitted
> A tab to easily see all clips or all screenshots
> Maybe a section for art too? There's been so much awesome art I've seen from this first event
